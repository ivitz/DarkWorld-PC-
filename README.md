# DarkWorld-PC-
A small part of an old and mostly legacy code for Unity3D fps/rpg game. My personal project. Though the code is old, it works perfectly fine.
The full project contains more than 10000 lines of code.

The current demo version of the game is available upon request.

Soon to be released on Steam.
